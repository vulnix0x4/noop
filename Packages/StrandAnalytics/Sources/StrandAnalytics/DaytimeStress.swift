// DaytimeStress.swift — an intraday (hour-by-hour) read of the SAME autonomic stress
// proxy the daily Stress monitor shows, computed from the day's banked HR + R-R.
//
// The daily Stress score (StressView / StressScreen) maps "resting HR up + HRV down vs
// a personal baseline" onto a 0–3 logistic. This helper applies that SAME math at the
// per-hour grain so the Stress screen can show *when* in the day stress ran high — not
// a new score. For each waking hour it computes:
//
//   • mean HR over the hour                    (HR up   = stress, like daily RHR)
//   • RMSSD over the hour's clean R-R          (HRV down = stress, like daily avgHRV)
//
// and z-scores each against the day's OWN quiet reference (the calm-hour median + the
// spread across hours), then squashes the z-sum onto 0–3 with the identical logistic
//   stress = 3 / (1 + e^(−raw)). 0 calm · 1.5 baseline · 3 high — same bands as the daily
// score. The day is its own baseline: a desk day with one tense afternoon reads that
// afternoon as elevated *relative to that person's own calm hours*, no cloud, no history
// needed beyond the day itself.
//
// "Sustained high stress" is an honest, conservative flag: the most recent
// `sustainedHours` covered hours must ALL sit in the HIGH band (≥ highBandFloor). It
// drives a passive in-app suggestion to run a Breathe session — never a notification.
//
// APPROXIMATE and non-clinical: an hour with too little data (few HR samples / too few
// clean beats) is reported as `.noData` and never invented.
